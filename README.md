 As we discussed there are 3 types of statistical data types as listed below:<br/>
 
 1) Numerical Data.<br/>
 Numerical data is also known as quantitative data, there are further categorized into Discrete and continous.

 Continous cases- <br/> speed of the car, Amount of  water in a bottle,  etc  <br/>
 Discrete cases- <br/>  IQ,  NUmber of heads after 20 coin tosses.<br/>
 2) Categorical Data.<br/> This data type does not have mathematical meaning,They are also know as qualitative data and describes characteristics.<br/>
 Examples: <br/>

  <br/> This data type mixes numerical and categorical data types A good example is Hotel Rating;<br/>
