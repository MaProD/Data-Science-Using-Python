##  Data-Science-Using-Python

# 12th november 2019  meet up discussion.

DATA SCIENCE: is the process of deriving knowledge and insights  from large set of data through organizing, processing and  and analysing the data. It is a multidisciplinary field that involved converting dta into information of knowledge. It combined different fields from mathematics to statistical computing to understanding business domain.
<br/>
We will be handling:<br/>
1). Data science and Data overview.<br/>
2). Python  for data science.</br>
3). Analysising data using Python.</br>
4). Data Visualization Using Python.</br>
5). An introduction to Hadoop. </br>
5). Machine learning using Python. </br>

We are aiming to complete the section on February 2020 with a Common Capstone project where everyone is free to participate.

Statistical data types:<br/>
 As we discussed there are 3 types of statistical data types as listed below:<br/>
 
 1) Numerical Data.<br/>
 Numerical data is also known as quantitative data, there are further categorized into Discrete and continous.
 <br/> examples<br/>
 Continous cases- <br/> speed of the car, Amount of  water in a bottle,  etc  <br/>
 Discrete cases- <br/>  IQ,  NUmber of heads after 20 coin tosses.<br/>
 2) Categorical Data.<br/> This data type does not have mathematical meaning,They are also know as qualitative data and describes characteristics.<br/>
 Examples: <br/>
 Gender, Enthinicity,Nationality. etc <br/>
 3) Ordina Data.
  <br/> This data type mixes numerical and categorical data types A good example is Hotel Rating;<br/>
  5 stars Hotel.
  3 stars Hotel.
